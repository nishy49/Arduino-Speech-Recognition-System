1] INTRODUCTION
In the world of Science, Artificial Intelligence is making rapid strides. Technology will be heavily dependent on Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task. Artificial Intelligence is used to perform narrow tasks such as voice recognition software to self driving cars .Based on various scientific studies and AI experts Artificial Intelligence will play a key role in science and development.
The project is aimed to control a miniature automobile using speech commands .When the machine recognizes the voice commands it will move accordingly. This automobile will not need a remote control to operate upon. The android will then convert the voice commands to direction commands .  The direction commands are then predefined and recognized by the automobile.

2] SPEECH RECOGNITION
When we say voice control the first term to be considered is speech recognition making the system understand human voice. Speech is an recognition in a technology where system understands the words given through. Speech is an ideal method for robotic control and communication. The speech recognition circuit will outline the automobile main intelligence processing  unit. The CPU merely poll the speech recognition lines occasionally to check if a command has been issued to a automobile. It     can also be improvised upon by this connecting the recognition line to one of the automobile’s CPU interrupt lines. By doing this a recognized word would cause an interrupt telling a CPU know a recognized word has been spoken.
The advantage of using an interrupt is that the polling’s the circuit’s recognition line occasionally would no longer necessarily further. Another advantage of speech recognition circuit is its programmability. We can program and train the SRC to recognize the words you want to be recognized. At the most basic level speech recognition is used to perform parallel tasks.
Hence speech recognition is one of the most simplest form of AI which can be used frequently and efficiently.
